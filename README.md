### Research Report on Bitcoin Layer-2 and Dogecoin Layer-2
### Bitcoin Layer-2

Bitcoin Layer-2 solutions refer to protocols built on top of Bitcoin’s base layer1. These protocols are developed to provide scalability to the Bitcoin network by processing transactions off the main blockchain1. They can also solve other technical difficulties and provide additional functionalities to Bitcoin1.
Challenges of Bitcoin That Layer-2s Address

The Bitcoin network has a scalability problem and suffers from slow transaction speeds, low throughput, and rising transaction costs1. Bitcoin has an average block creation time of 10 minutes and average throughput of seven (7) transactions per second (tps)1. Meanwhile, the network congestion drives up fees for transactions1.
Major Bitcoin Layer-2 Solutions

Major Bitcoin scaling solutions today include Lightning Network, Rootstock, Stacks, Liquid Network, and rollups (validity and sovereign)1. Each of these Layer-2 solutions provides value to the Bitcoin network and has the potential to help drive adoption to the wider Bitcoin ecosystem1.
Dogecoin Layer-2

Dogechain is a newly-launched blockchain platform that lets users bridge over Dogecoin (DOGE) and use it for DeFi, NFTs, and more2. Dogechain is a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain that runs on the Polygon network3. Polygon is Ethereum’s largest sidechain and is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine3. This means that Dogechain will also support apps and games developed for Ethereum3.
Dogechain Features

Dogechain touts itself as a “Layer 2 for Dogecoin.” It promises to bring DeFi, NFT, DApp and gaming use cases for holders of $DOGE3. This will provide the meme coin something it has been missing since its inception: utility3.
Dogechain’s Future Plans

Dogecoin is planning to increase block size so that they can process more transaction in every block4. More transaction per block will make network fast and also help gaming and web3 industry4.
Conclusion

Both Bitcoin and Dogecoin have Layer-2 solutions that aim to address the scalability issues inherent in their base layers. These Layer-2 solutions not only improve transaction speed and reduce costs, but also add functionalities such as DeFi, NFTs, and DApps. As these Layer-2 solutions continue to evolve, they are likely to play a crucial role in the future growth and adoption of these cryptocurrencies.

### Executive Summary:

Scaling remains a critical hurdle for Bitcoin and Dogecoin, hindering their mainstream adoption due to slow transaction speeds and high fees. This report delves deeper into the Layer 2 (L2) landscape for both networks, exploring specific solutions, their advantages and limitations, and potential future directions. By unpacking the technical intricacies and addressing key considerations, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how L2 technologies can unlock the full potential of Bitcoin and Dogecoin.

### Bitcoin L2:

# Challenges:

    Limited Block Size: Bitcoin's 1MB block size restricts transaction throughput, leading to backlogs and high fees during periods of high demand.
    Slow Confirmation Times: Transactions can take hours or even days to confirm, hampering real-world use cases like micropayments.
    Decentralization Trade-offs: Some L2 solutions compromise on Bitcoin's core principles of decentralization for improved scalability.

### L2 Solutions:

    Lightning Network:
        Description: An off-chain payment channel network enabling instant and near-zero-fee microtransactions. Users establish bilateral channels for fast value transfers, settling on-chain periodically.
        Advantages: High transaction throughput, low fees, suitable for everyday payments.
        Limitations: Requires liquidity in channels, limited smart contract functionality, vulnerable to routing attacks.
    State Channels:
        Description: Securely transfer assets and execute smart contracts off-chain, reducing on-chain congestion. Both parties lock funds in a multi-signature contract, updating states off-chain and settling on-chain only when necessary.
        Advantages: Flexible for complex transactions and smart contracts, privacy-preserving.
        Limitations: Complex setup and management, requires trust between counterparties.
    Plasma:
        Description: Scalable sidechains with their own consensus mechanisms, inheriting Bitcoin's security through periodic checkpoints. Transactions occur on the sidechain with fast finality, periodically committing state updates to the main chain.
        Advantages: High transaction throughput, enables full smart contract functionality, inherits Bitcoin's security.
        Limitations: Introduces additional complexity and potential centralization points, security depends on sidechain design and checkpointing frequency.

### Adoption and Outlook:

# L2 adoption for Bitcoin is still in its early stages, but several factors indicate promising potential:

    Growing ecosystem: Increasing user awareness, expanding infrastructure (wallets, liquidity providers), and cross-chain integrations are boosting adoption.
    Development advancements: Ongoing research and development are enhancing security, privacy, and user experience of L2 solutions.
    Regulatory clarity: Evolving regulatory frameworks are providing guidelines for L2 operations, fostering wider institutional adoption.

However, challenges remain:

    Complexity: Setting up and using L2 solutions can be challenging for non-technical users, hindering mainstream adoption.
    Decentralization concerns: Centralized elements within some L2 designs raise concerns about compromising Bitcoin's core principles.
    Interoperability: Fragmented L2 landscape with limited interoperability poses challenges for seamless user experience.

Addressing these challenges through continued development, collaboration, and user education is crucial for unlocking the full potential of L2 technologies and realizing Bitcoin's vision of a global, decentralized payment network.

### Dogecoin L2:

# Challenges:

    Incompatible with Existing L2s: Dogecoin's Scrypt hashing algorithm makes it incompatible with many L2 solutions designed for Bitcoin's SHA-256 algorithm.
    Lower Transaction Fees: Dogecoin's inherently fast and cheap transactions may not justify the complexity of implementing some L2 solutions.
